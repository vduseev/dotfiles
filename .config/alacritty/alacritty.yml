# Import additional configuration files

# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
import:
  - ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.base.yml
  - ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.local.yml

# Put your changes into the ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.local.yml file
# and they will overwrite the settings in the base.
